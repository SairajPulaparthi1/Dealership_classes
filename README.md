# Dealership_classes

This project focused on developing proficiency in C++ through the creation of three interrelated classes: Vehicle, Showroom, and Dealership. Emphasizing the implementation of special functions such as copy constructors, assignment operators, and destructors, as well as dynamic memory allocation, the project provided practical exposure to object-oriented programming concepts.
